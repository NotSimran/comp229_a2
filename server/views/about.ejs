        Hi, My name is Simranjeet Kaur 👋🏼. I'm a 21 year old Front End Engineer based in Toronto ☀️. I
        describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding, open source, and the web platform
        ❤️.

        Aside from my job, I like to create and contribute to open source projects. That helps me to
        learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects. Also I
        enjoy writing technical things ✍️ at my blog.

        In my free time you can find me longboarding 🛹 , at the gym 🏋️‍♂️, at the beach 🏖 or on tech
        meetups and conferences around Toronto and India.</p><br>
